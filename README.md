.vim for syncing

Clone this directory into the home directory, it should appear as `.vim`.

The file `dotvimrc.copy` is the `.vimrc` file, and so a symlink called `.vimrc` should be created in the home directory pointing to this file.

`.vimrc` is for language agnostic settings. For individual file types, configuration can be done via `ftplugin/`
